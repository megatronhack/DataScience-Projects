## Dataset

[Kaggle mobile price classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification)
## Project Mobile Price Classification 

## GOAL 
Find the best machine learning model/method for our dataset
<br/>
## Executive Summary
This is a mobile price classification dataset from Kaggle. The reason that I choose this dataset is that it is a supervised learning problem. We are examing machine learning algorithms on the mobile dataset to predict the mobile price and decided which model is the best one for this dataset. <br/>

Three methods<br/>
### "i":  Classifier methods <br/>
### "ii": Ensemble method  <br/>
### "iii":Deep learning, neural network method
