# Machine Learning Projects


## ML Algorithms On Mobile Price Classification Dataset
### GOAL 
Find the best machine learning model/method for our dataset<br/>
we will be using three methods<br/>
### "i":  Classifier methods <br/>
### "ii": Ensemble method  <br/>
### "iii":Deep learning, neural network method <br/>

## Twitter Sentiment Analtsis on tweets from twitter API
Implementing machine learning sentiment analysis models in order to compute public sentiment.
We are choosing twitter to work with because we believe Twitter is one of the most important social media platforms and it has a better evaluation of public sentiment than other social media platforms.

## Artificial Neural Network Model Build from Scrach
This project is using artificial neuron network models to perform addition with two inputs and multiplication with two inputs.  To test the accuracy, we are using and changing parameters such as iterations, regularization parameter, learning rate, number of hidden layer nodes.

# Data Analysis Projects

## Logistic Regression Analysis On Email Spam Data
This report is about performing logistic regression over the given dataset which has a shape of (3921,21) in which we have to predict or classify weather the given email is spam or not using the logistic regression and analyse the result.<BR/>
we analysing the given data set using different Pandas functions and performing model building,analysing summary, predicting over the test data, plotting, finding optimal threshold, ROC curve. <BR/>
In the end, we find the AUC and judge the efficiency of the model and find the optimal point in ROC curve finally getting threshold.

## Anova Analysis On School Data
One way analysis of this dataset is to find out if the means of the dataset are varied from each other.
